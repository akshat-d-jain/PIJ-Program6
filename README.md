# Duck Squawk Files Behavior

## Introduction
This repository contains a Java project that demonstrates the behavior of different types of ducks and their squawking functionality. 

## Files
1. **Main.java**: This file contains the main method that creates instances of various duck types and demonstrates their behavior.

2. **RedHeadDuck.java**: This class represents a RedHeadDuck which extends the Duck class. It defines the display, performFly, and performQuack methods specific to a RedHeadDuck.

3. **RubberDuck.java**: This class represents a RubberDuck which extends the Duck class. It defines the display method specific to a RubberDuck.

4. **Duck.java**: This is the parent class for all types of ducks. It contains common behavior and properties shared among all ducks.

5. **FlyBehavior.java**: This interface defines the fly behavior of ducks. Each duck class implements this interface to provide its specific flying behavior.

6. **QuackBehavior.java**: This interface defines the quack behavior of ducks. Each duck class implements this interface to provide its specific quacking behavior.

## Instructions
To run the program, compile all Java files and execute the Main class. The program will create instances of RedHeadDuck and RubberDuck, displaying their respective behaviors.

## Usage
You can use this project to understand and explore the concept of polymorphism and behavior delegation in object-oriented programming, specifically in the context of ducks and their squawking behavior.
